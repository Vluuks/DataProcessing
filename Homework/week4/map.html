<!--

	The mouseover events in this map are rather simple, they only show the name of the country and the amount of threatened plants.
	As my dataset did not contain more data than that there is not much more to show. =( The mouseover also triggers a change of the stroke
	and color of the counry being hovered over, so that it should be clear which one it is. The big stroke helps show which country is selected
	even in the event of someone not being able to distinguish the mouseover color from the natural colors. 
	
	In addition there is an option to change the color as well, so if someone would have a hard time distinguishing various shades of red they
	could use this drop down menu to change the color to blue or green. The map only shows colors in the same hue, and are made in such 
	a way that they also should look decent in black and white/grayscale. This should help colorblind people to read the map better, because
	the contrast between light and dark is preserved, even when the color itself cannot be accurately seen.
	
	The saturation is not too bright, the colors are a bit muted, this is	more pleasant on the eye for larger areas like they appear on a map.
